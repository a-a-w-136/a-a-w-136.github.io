                        <div class="Brief_Body">
                            <p>The Kingston and Arthurs vale Historic Area (<abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs vale Historic Area">KAvHA</abbr>) is of outstanding significance to the nation as a convict settlement spanning the era of transportation to eastern Australia between <time datetime="1788">1788</time> and <time datetime="1855">1855</time>.</p>

                            <p>Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk island. Stone tools found at both Emily and Slaughter Bays within KAvHA indicate that Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD <time datetime="1200">1200</time> and AD <time datetime="1600">1600</time>.</p>
                            <img src="NorfolkImages/Cook.jpeg" alt="Captain Cook" id="NI_Introduction_Captain_Cook" class="NI_Img">
                            <p>Visited by Captain James Cook RN in <time datetime="1774">1774</time>, Norfolk island was settled on <time datetime="1788-3-6">6 March 1788</time>, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney. A settlement was established at Kingston, with crops sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs vale. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third of Sydney’s population to Kingston.</p>

                            <p>Both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The settlement’s population peaked at 1156 in <time datetime="1792-5">May 1792</time>. By <time datetime="1804">1804</time>, the free settlers on the island signicantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 per cent of the total population of 1084. Abandoned in <time datetime="1814">1814</time>, the settlement’s buildings were destroyed in <time datetime="1825">1825</time>, the island was re-occupied to provide secondary punishment of convicts. Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies. It was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony.</p>

                            <p><abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs vale Historic Area">KAvHA</abbr> developed a reputation as one of the harshest and cruelest of Australia’s penal settlements. The worst of the convict population from both New South Wales and van Diemen’s Land were sent to Norfolk island. They were men who had become so brutalised by the system that ever increasing levels of punishment only served to make them more recalcitrant.</p>

                            <p>Alexander Maconochie, commandant of Norfolk island, brought a humanising regime of reform to the second settlement period for four of its 30 years. He introduced the Merits System of Penal Discipline, which worked on the principle that the prisoner could secure freedom if they were industrious and well-behaved. For a number of reasons, including the fact that his superiors disapproved of his reformist actions, his initiatives failed.</p>

                            <p>The latter stages of the second settlement saw prisoners arriving direct from Britain to serve the first stage of their punishment under the new probation system introduced in <time datetime="1843">1843</time>. The severity of the place continued and a critical report to the British Parliament helped bring an end to the island’s use as a penal settlement. It was gradually closed between <time datetime="1847">1847</time> and <time datetime="1855">1855</time>.</p>

                            <p>After this, the Pitcairn island descendents of the Bounty mutineers had outgrown their island home, and the British Government chose to resettle them on Norfolk island. The whole Pitcairn community landed at Kingston Pier on <time datetime="1856-6-8">8 June 1856</time>.</p>

                            <p>Their descendents, who today comprise nearly a third of Norfolk island’s population, still speak the Pitcairn language.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <div class="Description_Body">
                        <p>Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area (<abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr>) is situated on the southern side of Norfolk Island fronting Slaughter Bay. Referred to as <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> it is a cultural landscape which includes an agrarian landscape (Arthurs Vale, Watermill valley and the northern hillsides) and the settled coastal plain at Kingston. Hills to the north and west fringe the settlement on the coastal plain. Roads provide ways through <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr>, linking the groups of structures, access to the landing place, the foreshore, the cemetery and bridges. The Kingston plain is Norfolk’s only coastal plain area with beach, dune and a coral edged lagoon.</p>

                        <p>The convict barracks and gaol were located on the foreshore. Swampy land separated the convict accommodation from the military and civil accommodation arranged on the inland side of the coastal flat while a succession of Government houses were positioned in commanding locations. The many surviving buildings at the site reflect these arrangements.</p> 

                        <p>The cleared nature of the landscape, along with the siting and orientation of important buildings are an explicit demonstration of the settlement and penal philosophy of the British Empire in colonial Australia, being designed to provide for the continual surveillance of convicts and allow for agricultural requirements. Modification to the landscape through earthworks to facilitate the construction of buildings or protect agricultural plots (the <em>'causeway'</em>) and the large scale quarrying of limestone and the coral reef, illustrate attitudes to landscape based primarily on its value as a resource. Surviving evidence also illustrates aspects of design and process from the First and Second Settlements. This includes the remnant serpentine landscape and ornamental garden of Government House, the formal streetscape qualities of Quality Row, and evidence of communications through maintaining visual links and operation of a semaphore system. Evidence from the third settlement period is the introduction of new plant species, swamp drainage works, memorial plantings and reforestation to address erosion on the hill slopes. </p>

                        <p><abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> is <em>rare</em>, being the site of, and probably containing extensive archaeological evidence of the earliest European settlement from Australia to the south-west Pacific (<time datetime="1788">1788</time>), similar in size for a decade to the other initial settlement at Sydney Cove. Its significance is enhanced by the lack of substantial subsequent development. It contains areas and individual elements that are confirmed or well documented sites of First Settlement buildings and activities (<time datetime="1788">1788</time>-<time datetime="1814">1814</time>). The subsurface archaeological remains of the first and second Government Houses (<time datetime="1788">1788</time>-<time datetime="1803">1803</time>) are, along with First Government House Sydney (<time datetime="1788">1788</time>-<time datetime="1847">1847</time>), the oldest government house sites in Australia.</p> 

                        <p>The concentration and intactness of fabric is considered <em>rare</em>. The intact layout, form and fabric of the place illustrate the patterns of human occupation, ways of life, and perceptions and values of the landscape, and accumulative impact of Europeans on a pristine natural environment (Australian Construction Services, <time datetime="1994">1994</time>).</p>

                        <p><abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> is significant for its richness of settlement history and array of extant features. It contains areas, buildings and other elements of outstanding individual cultural significance including Government House (<time datetime="1829">1829</time>), one of the earliest and most intact remaining government house buildings in Australia, along with Old Government House Parramatta, and the Old Military Barracks (now the Legislative Assembly and Norfolk Island Court) (<time datetime="1829">1829</time>). The Old Military Barracks, together with the Commissariat Store and the New Military Barracks (now Norfolk Island Government Administration offices) (<time datetime="1836">18236</time>), form a group of buildings which is the most substantial military barracks complex in Australia dating from the 1830s. The Commissariat Store (now All Saints Church) (<time datetime="1835">1835</time>) is one of the finest remaining colonial (pre <time datetime="1850">1850</time>) military commissariat stores in Australia along with that at Darlington (Tasmania). The soldiers' barracks is one of the <em>finest</em> military barrack buildings built in Australia in the nineteenth century.</p>

                        <p>There are nine houses providing quarters for military and civil officers (<time datetime="1832">1832</time> to <time datetime="1847">1847</time>). Other features include: perimeter walls and archaeological remains of Prisoners' Barracks (<time datetime="1828">1828</time> to <time datetime="1848">1848</time>) including the Protestant Chapel; perimeter walls and archaeological remains of the New Prison (Pentagonal Prison) (<time datetime="1836">1836</time> to <time datetime="1840">1840</time>, <time datetime="1845">1845</time> to <time datetime="1857">1857</time>); ruins of the hospital, built on First Settlement remains (<time datetime="1829">1829</time>); the Surgeon's Quarters and Kitchen (<time datetime="1827">1827</time>) on the site of First Settlement Government House, one of the earliest European dwellings in Australia; the Landing Pier (<time datetime="1839">1839</time> to <time datetime="1847">1847</time>) built over the First Settlement landing place and sea wall, two of the earliest remaining large scale engineering works in Australia; Beach store (<time datetime="1825">1825</time>); Settlement Guardhouse (<time datetime="1826">1826</time>) on the foundations of First Settlement building; Crankmill (<time datetime="1827">1827</time> to <time datetime="1838">1838</time>), the remains of the only known human powered crankmill built in Australia before <time datetime="1850">1850</time>; Royal Engineer's office and stables (<time datetime="1850">1850</time>); Double Boat Shed (<time datetime="1841">1841</time>); Police Office, now boatshed (<time datetime="1828">1828</time> to <time datetime="1838">1829</time>); Flaghouse (<time datetime="1840">1840</time>s); Constable's Quarters, partly standing (<time datetime="1850">1850</time> to <time datetime="1853">1853</time>); Blacksmith's Shop (<time datetime="1846">1846</time>); Salt House (<time datetime="1847">1847</time>); and Windmill base (<time datetime="1842">1842</time> to <time datetime="1843">1843</time>).</p> 

                        <p>The Cemetery has an <em>outstanding</em> collection of headstones and other remains dating from the earliest period of European settlement, including the first and second penal settlement periods and the Pitcairn period with associations with the Bounty, set in an evocative and picturesque historical landscape. Many stone walls, wells, drains, building platforms, bridges, culverts, roads, quarry sites, privies and archaeological sites of former buildings are important remains. These include Bloody Bridge. The remnant serpentine landscape is an outstanding example of colonial period (pre-<time datetime="1850">1850</time>) attitudes to landscape design in Australia which reflected contemporary English attitudes to landscape design.</p> 

                        <p>The place is <em>particularly</em> infamous as one of two places of secondary punishment within the Australian colonies (the other being Port Arthur). Its reputation was renowned throughout the British Empire to act as a deterrent to further convict crime in the colonies. It is also associated with an experiment in penal reform in the NSW colony which underpinned modern approaches to penal practice internationally. It has an association with Australia's founding and early personalities such as King, Hunter, Foveaux, Wentworth, Anderson, Maconochie, Price and Cash. It is also associated with the <time datetime="1790">1790</time> wreck of HMS Sirius, the flagship of the First Fleet and the only sizable warship available to defend the colony which was about to sail to China to obtain desperately needed food supplies for the colony at Sydney Cove (Australian Construction Services, <time datetime="1994">1994</time>).</p> 

                        <p>The place is rich in aesthetic qualities due to the combination of spatial structure, visual quality and the strong relationship between built elements and their setting. Apart from visual quality, the places is a rich source of other sensory stimuli; the sounds, tastes and textures are all products of the friction wrought between such natural elements as wind, water and sun. Oceanic influences render the natural lighting of the place very changeable over a day, and dramatise the scene. The combination of cultural expression, natural forces and their resultant patterns enable a perception and interpretation of the place as a '<em>picturesque</em>' and '<em>romantic</em>' landscape made up of a number of elements including natural/built edges, sea/landscape vistas, gardens, rural pastures, cleared hills and formal plantings (Australian Construction Services, <time datetime="1994">1994</time>).</p> 

                        <p>The Sirius wreck (<time datetime="1790">1790</time>) remains on the seabed off the reef in Slaughter Bay. The first anchor raised was in <time datetime="1903">1903</time>. Artefacts have been recovered from the wreck, some of which form part of the collection housed in the Norfolk Island Museum. The artefact collection, in combination with a detailed written record, has outstanding research potential for information about the lives of the bond and free in the early convict period. Other relics, including two of the Sirius anchors are on the mainland. The large anchor is displayed in Macquarie Place, Sydney and another is in the Maritime Museum in Sydney.</p>

                        <p>The low-lying land of <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> is generally composed of calcarenite, a limestone formed of cemented cross-bedded calcareous sand, the remnants of a formerly much more extensive coral formation (Tropman and Tropman <time datetime="1994">1994</time>). The dunes behind Emily Bay and Cemetery Beach contain a number of small fossil and sub-fossil deposits of recent age (between 450 and 7 000 years BP). These sites have yielded some fossilised vertebrate bones, remains of several land snail species that are now considered to be extinct or extremely rare, and fossilised seeds and logs of the Norfolk Island Pine (Tropman and Tropman <time datetime="1994">1994</time>; Anderson and White <time datetime="2001">2001</time>; DEH <time datetime="2005">2005</time>). These fossils provide evidence of plant and animal life that existed on Norfolk Island before human occupation. </p>

                        <p>Most of <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> has been cleared and the original vegetation severely modified. Tropman and Tropman (<time datetime="1994">1994</time>) describe it as dominated by Kikuyu grass and note that while the sheltered gullies contain some remnant ferns, mixed hardwoods and white oaks, they have been colonised by weed species such as olives and lantana.  <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> may still support a small population of a rare landsnail (Mathewsoconcha suteri).</p>
