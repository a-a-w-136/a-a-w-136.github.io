                        <p>Europeans were not the first people to inhabit Norfolk Island. Stone tools have been found at both Emily and Slaughter bays within <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr>. Archaeological investigations have revealed evidence of landscape modifications in the Emily Bay area including artefact assemblages and structural remains that have been interpreted as a rudimentary marae, a religious structure characteristic of East Polynesian culture. Radiocarbon dating indicates Polynesian settlement of the area occurred between AD <time datetime="1200">1200</time> and AD <time datetime="1600">1600</time>.</p>

                            <h4>The First European Settlement</h4>
                            <p>Discovered by Captain James Cook RN in <time datetime="1774">1774</time>, Norfolk Island was settled on <time datetime="1788-3-6">6 March 1788</time>, six weeks after the First Fleet landed in Sydney. Cook reported the island had rich soils, tall pines suitable for ships masts and spars, and native flax that could be used for making canvas. Governor Philip had instructions to settle and secure the island <em>as soon as possible</em> to secure its potential naval supplies.</p>
                            <p>
                            Arriving on the Supply, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King RN and a party of nine male and six female convicts and seven staff established a settlement named Kingston. Crops were sown in the adjoining valley, Arthurs Vale, and, unlike the experience in Sydney, the Kingston crops flourished. To relieve the food pressures in the infant colony of New South Wales, Governor Philip relocated around one-third Sydney's population to Kingston.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Extensive clearing followed and both convicts and free settlers farmed small holdings of land. The rising land behind Kingston was cleared for surveillance and to ensure there was no cover for escaping convicts. The first settlement's population peaked at 1156 in <time datetime="1792-5">May 1792</time>. By <time datetime="1804">1804</time> the free settlers on the island significantly outnumbered the convicts who represented 23 percent of the total population of 1084. On its abandonment in <time datetime="1814">1814</time> the settlement's buildings were destroyed.

                            <p>
                            In response to the report by Commissioner Bigge (<time datetime="1822">1822</time> to <time datetime="1823">1823</time>) on the effectiveness of transportation, the Colonial Secretary Lord Bathurst instructed Governor Brisbane in <time datetime="1824">1824</time> to re-occupy the island as a 'great hulk or penitentiary' to provide secondary punishment. Secondary punishment was designed to revive the fear of transportation and deter crime in Britain and the colonies, and was a sentence applied to transported convicts who re-offended in the colony.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Norfolk Island was re-occupied on <time datetime="1825-6-6">6 June 1825</time> by Captain Turton as commandant, with a party of 50 soldiers, 57 convicts, six women and six children. The settlement was again located around Kingston and the remains of some first settlement buildings were rebuilt, old agricultural areas rehabilitated and new areas cleared. But it was to be of an entirely different character to the first settlement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The second settlement on Norfolk Island was designed to be the <em>extreme</em> in convict degradation and the came to stand for worst of the transportation system.

                            <h4>Hell On Earth</h4>
                            <p>Convicts worked from sunrise to sunset. Agricultural work was done with hoes and spades, and no ploughs or working cattle were used. Convict accommodation was cramped and unsanitary and this, combined with their poor diet of one meal every 48 hours, resulted in poor health and many deaths. The harshness and degradation of the treatment metered out to the convicts was intended to break them. Floggings were common, even for trivial offences, and sentences could be extended.</p>
                            <p>The worst of the convict population from both New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land were sent to Norfolk Island; men who had become <em>sobrutalised</em> by the system that ever increasing levels of punishment only served to make them more recalcitrant. The prospect of punishment by death was non deterrent.</p>
                            <p>The <em>ruthless men</em> charged with running Norfolk Island and controlling its convict population were themselves part of a brutal system.</p>
                            <p>A number of the commandants, including Captain James Morisset, Major Joseph Childs and John Price, were particularly cruel. Mutinies and uprisings were not uncommon and invariably led to floggings and hangings. It was during Morisset's period as commandant (<time datetime="1829">1829</time>-<time datetime="1834">1834</time>), which was noted for his extensive use of the lash, that Norfolk Island became renowned as '<em>hell on earth</em>' and by 1833 the island's fearsome reputation was well known in Britain.</p>

                            <p>
                            Only one commandant of Norfolk Island, Alexander Maconochie, brought a <em>humanising</em> regime of reform to the second settlement period through four of its 30 years. He introduced the Merits System of Penal Discipline, which worked on the principle that the prisoner could secure freedom if they were industrious and well behaved. For a number of reasons, including the fact that his superiors disapproved of his reformist actions, his reforms failed. Under Maconochie's humanitarian influence the conditions for prisoners had improved. They rapidly deteriorated, however, under the next commandant, Major Joseph Childs.

                            <p>The latter stages of the second settlement saw prisoners arriving direct from Britain to serve the first stage of their punishment under the new probation system introduced in <time datetime="1843">1843</time>. The severity of the place continued and in his report to the British Parliament in <time datetime="1847">1847</time>, Catholic Bishop Robert Wilson detailed the appalling conditions on Norfolk Island. His report helped bring an end to the island's use as a penal settlement. It was gradually closed between 1847 and 1855 with some convicts having been released on tickets of leave, while others were taken to Port Arthur where they served out their sentences. An Order in Council made on <time datetime="1853-12-29">29 December 1853</time>, repealed all previous orders making Norfolk Island a penal settlement. A small party remained on the island to care for the farms and livestock and to handover to the incoming settlers from Pitcairn Island, who constituted the third settlement phase of the island's history.</p>

                            <p>As the Pitcairn Island descendents of the Bounty mutineers had outgrown their island home, the British government chose to resettle them on Norfolk Island. The whole Pitcairn community landed at Kingston Pier on <time datetime="1856-6-8">29 December 1853</time>8 June 1856.</p>
                            <p>Their descendents, who today comprise nearly a third of Norfolk Island's population, still speak the Pitcairn language. For them <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> is a place of special significance because it has been continually and actively used since their arrival as a place of residence, work, worship and recreation. <abbr title="Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area">KAVHA</abbr> is uncommon as a place where a distinctive Polynesian/European community has lived and practised their cultural traditions for over 150 years.</p>
